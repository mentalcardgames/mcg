The bots being driven should always be happening if it isn't a player's turn.
It shouldn't be triggered by a player action either. 
Simplify it so there aren't different locations and triggers for bot
drivers

I also added some TODO comments to parts of the code which could be problematic,
look at those and come up with better logic.
