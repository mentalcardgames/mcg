QR-STREAM PROTOCOL SPECIFICATION
Version 0.3 – 29-Sep-2025

---
## 0. Unknowns

- Are vector clocks needed?
- Number of Participants are not finalised
- Size of Epoch not finalised
- Number of concurrent Epochs
- Max size of AP nof finalised

## 1. Purpose (one sentence)
QR-STREAM is a unidirectional, byte-stream protocol that fragments application packets.
Frames are broadcasted and network coded as QR-codes at 20 Hz;
receivers may read at 20, 40 or 60 Hz and reconstruct packets.

## 2. Terminology & conventions

- All multi-byte integers little-endian unless noted.
- “Frame”: the complete payload inside the QR-Code.
- “Fragment”: logical piece of an application packet carried inside one frame.
- “AP”: Application Packet.

## 3. Limits
- Participants: ≤ 2^4
- Fragment size: 676 B ≤ 2^10 B
- Epoch size: 465088 B ≤ 2^19 B
- Reserved size per participant in each epoch: 29068 B ≤ 2^15 B
- Encoding over GF(2^8)

## 4. Frame layout

| 0…687          | 688…1363 | 1364…1366 |
|----------------|----------|-----------|
| Coding Factors | Fragment | Header    |

### 4.1 Fragment

A fragment is a linear combination over GF(2^8) of all known fragments from the current Epoch.

### 4.2 Header

| Byte | Field                      |
|------|----------------------------|
| 0    | Participant ID             |
| 1    | Is this Frame overflowing? |
| 2    | Epoch                      |

The first byte is holding the senders ID.
The second and third byte are holding the size of the players newest AP.
The forth byte is telling if this frame is overflowing.
This means that unused space of other participants has to be flooded with zeros.
The last byte is referring to the current epoch.

### 4.3 Coding Factors

- Logical fragments are encoded over a GF(2^8) Field
- Our epoch has 465088 B, made up of 676 B big fragments which corresponds to 688 fragments in the epoch.
- For 16 participants, each gets assigned 43 fragments.
- For network coding we include factors from GF(2^8) for every fragment in the epoch.

## 5. Epoch layout

| Fragment | Participant |
|----------|-------------|
| 0…42     | first       |
| 43…85    | second      |
| …        | …           |
| 644…687  | last        |

## 6. Timing

| Side     | Rate            | Notes                    |
|----------|-----------------|--------------------------|
| Sender   | 20 Hz           | One frame per QR update. |
| Receiver | 20 / 40 / 60 Hz | Device-dependent         |

## 7. QR presentation limits

| Version | Modules | ECC | Usable Bytes (after ECC) |
|---------|---------|-----|--------------------------|
| 1       | 21×21   | H   | 7                        |
| 1       | 21×21   | L   | 17                       |
| 26      | 121×121 | L   | 1367                     |
| 26      | 121×121 | M   | 1059                     |
| 40      | 177×177 | H   | 1273                     |
| 40      | 177×177 | L   | 2953                     |


→ QR Codes can store 1367-bytes with Version 26 and L redundancy.

## 8. User interaction

- Sender: shows continuously cycling QR frames.
- Receiver: points camera; UI shows
  - current fragment progress,
  - Min-clock (oldest packet not yet reconstructed),
  - Max-clock (newest packet known to exist).

## 9. State diagram (informal)

Sender:
Idle → Acquire AP → Fragment → Encode → Show each frame for 50 ms.

Receiver:
Scan → Buffer frames → Decode coded groups → Re-assemble AP → Update clocks → Deliver to application.

## 11. Security considerations

#### None.

It is possible for a participant to poison the whole network by transmissing bogus data.
Reading a bogus frame immediately poisons the participant.
