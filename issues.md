# Code Architecture Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

The MCG project is a well-structured Rust workspace implementing a browser-based card game with WASM frontend and native backend. The codebase demonstrates good separation of concerns with clear layering between frontend, backend, and shared protocol types. However, several architectural issues, error handling inconsistencies, and potential maintenance concerns have been identified that could lead to bugs or technical debt.

## Critical Issues

## Architectural Concerns

### 5. **Complex State Management in Connection Service**
**Location**: `/home/benjamin/workspace/mcg/frontend/src/game/connection.rs:15-18`
**Impact**: Medium - Difficult to reason about state flow
**Issue**: The connection service mixes WebSocket management with message queuing and event handling, making it difficult to track state transitions.

**Suggested Fix**: Separate concerns into distinct components: connection manager, message queue, and event dispatcher.
