# MCG

A mental card game implementation in the browser.

## Features

- Card rendering and management
- Game field layouts
- Drag and drop interactions
- Screen management system
- WASM compatibility for web deployment

## Running the WASM Frontend

To run the WASM frontend in a browser:

### Option 1: One-step build and serve

```bash
./start.sh
```

This will build the WASM package and start a local web server in one step.

### Option 2: Manual steps

1. Build the WASM package:
   ```bash
   ./wasm-build.sh
   ```

2. Start a simple HTTP server to serve the files:
   ```bash
   # Using the provided script:
   ./serve.sh

   # Or manually:
   python -m http.server 8080
   # Or with Node.js:
   # npx http-server -p 8080
   ```

3. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080/

### Directory Structure for WASM

For the WASM version to work correctly, maintain this structure:
```
mcg/
├── index.html     # The HTML entry point
├── pkg/           # Generated by wasm-pack
├── media/         # Media assets for cards
│   ├── img_cards/ # Standard card images
│   └── alt_cards/ # Alternative card designs
```


## Development Workflow

1. Make changes to the code
2. Run `./wasm-build.sh --dev` to rebuild the WASM package (dev makes the
   compilation faster, but the binary bigger) and then run `./serve.sh` to start
   a local web server (if not already running)
3. Refresh your browser to see the changes
