# MCG

A mental card game implementation in the browser.

## Features

- Card rendering and management
- Game field layouts
- Drag and drop interactions
- Screen management system
- WASM compatibility for web deployment

## Running the WASM Frontend


### Build and serve with just

Use the included Justfile (install `just` from your package manager).

```bash
# Build the WASM package
just build

# Serve the current directory on http://localhost:8080
just serve

# Build then serve in one step (optional args passed to wasm-pack)
just start 8080 -- --dev
```

Then open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080/

### Directory Structure for WASM

For the WASM version to work correctly, maintain this structure:
```
mcg/
├── index.html     # The HTML entry point
├── pkg/           # Generated by wasm-pack
├── media/         # Media assets for cards
│   ├── img_cards/ # Standard card images
│   └── alt_cards/ # Alternative card designs
```


## Development Workflow

1. Make changes to the code
2. Run `just build -- --dev` to rebuild the WASM package (dev makes the
   compilation faster, but the binary bigger) and then run `just serve` to start
   a local web server (if not already running)
3. Refresh your browser to see the changes
