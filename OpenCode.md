# OpenCode Guidelines

## Build/Lint/Test Commands
- **Build**: Run `./wasm-build.sh` for the WASM package.
- **Serve and Build**: Use `./wasm-build.sh --dev` to build and serve locally.
- **Testing**: Use `cargo test` to run all tests. To run a specific test, append `--lib <test_name>`.

## Code Style Guidelines
- **Imports**:
  - Use explicit imports 
  - Group `use` statements by external crates separately from local modules.

- **Formatting**:
  - Indentation uses spaces consistently across the project.
  - Wrap chained calls and scoped let-statements neatly.
